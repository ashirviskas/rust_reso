A clean implementation of [Reso](https://github.com/lynnpepin/reso) using Rust.

## Disclaimer
I made this project just for learning purposes, it may not be maintained or updated, but a PR fixing or improving this implementation is always welcome.

It's also made from scratch, no original code was looked at while developing, so some functionalities may differ from the original.

## Build/run instructions
TODO
1. Install Rust
2. `cargo run`

## TODO
1. Compile to WebAssembly
2. Make interactive
3. Add more todos
